## Getting Started

1. Ensure the `amazon-chime-sdk-js` Node server is running. This provides us with the API endpoints to join/start a team conversation (i.e., Meeting/Attendee).
2. Run `npm run start` from the root folder.
3. You should be prompted by your browser for video/audio device access, display your local preview video in the DOM.
